# MurriBot

A project of Social Media Technologies. The aim of the project is to build a theoretical framework and a prototype implementation of a chatbot called MurriBot, based on gamification and storytelling, that is able to offer an alternative way for dissemnating knowledge about one of the most interesting and disconcerting crime cases ever happened in Italy: the **case of Murri**.
